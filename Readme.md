# Solar Energy Optimization Platform

## Overview
The Solar Energy Optimization Platform is designed to help households and businesses optimize their energy consumption using solar panels. The platform leverages Time-of-Use (TOU) and Time-of-Day (TOD) tariffs to maximize savings by shifting energy usage to cheaper periods and utilizing stored solar energy during peak times.

## Problem Statement
As energy costs continue to rise, there is a pressing need for an intelligent system that can help users monitor and manage their energy consumption effectively. This platform provides real-time tariff monitoring, energy consumption analytics, smart scheduling for appliances, and solar energy management, all while offering personalized recommendations and alerts.

## Features
1. **Real-Time Tariff Monitoring**:
   - Display current and upcoming electricity prices.
   - Forecast TOU tariff rates using simulated utility data.

2. **Energy Consumption Analytics**:
   - Monitor energy consumption patterns.
   - Provide detailed reports on usage, costs, and savings with visualizations (charts/graphs).

3. **Smart Scheduling**:
   - Automate appliance scheduling during low-tariff periods.
   - Integrate with smart home devices for seamless energy management.

4. **Solar Energy Management**:
   - Track real-time solar energy production and usage.
   - Manage battery storage for peak period utilization.

5. **Forecasting and Recommendations**:
   - Use machine learning to predict energy consumption and solar production.
   - Provide personalized recommendations based on tariff forecasts.

6. **User Notifications and Alerts**:
   - Send notifications on high-tariff periods.
   - Alert users about selling excess energy back to the grid.

7. **Cost-Benefit Analysis**:
   - Calculate savings from energy shifting and solar usage.
   - Display historical performance metrics.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: React.js, HTML, CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Data Processing**: Cloud-based solutions (AWS or equivalent)
- **Machine Learning**: Python with TensorFlow or PyTorch for forecasting and optimization

## Installation
